# Pokestats
 A data/visualizations frontend application that allow users to view interesting statistics on their favourite Pokemon.
 
 1. All data, charts and stats you will see on this web app were coded up using an open pokemon dataset from Kaggle.
 2. I wrote individual scripts for each class of statistic I wanted to display in Python using pandas/numpy, and converted the raw csv data produced by those scripts into json format.
 3. After parsing through the json data files with javascript and react hooks, I displayed the data in tables and charts using Chart.js, Bootstrap and the react animate library.
 4. I even added a searchable, paginated pokedex on the landing page, which is filterable by the name or type of the pokemon you may be interested in.
 5. This project was my first shot at trying out React to build a web app, and I learned a LOT. so enjoy and have a look!
